This is a portfolio project using an inverted index for a basic search engine. Searchable documents stored in the program are custom strings. 
The search engine utses tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming to improve search accuracy. 
For keyword searches, it ranks results based on TF-IDF scores, prioritizing documents where the search terms are more significant.
